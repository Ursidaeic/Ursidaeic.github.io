						<h2>Project Overview</h2>
						<p>
							This project was an investigation into the ways in which English-speaking audiences receive popular foreign language music on YouTube. 
							On this site, you will be able to follow the methodological steps taken throughout this journey and reapply them to your own ends should you so wish.
							These steps encompass several diverse areas, such as web-scraping, API usage, machine learning, and clustering methodologies. 
						</p> 
						<br>
						<p>In the project, I carried out three seperate case studies. The first was an examination into the role of fandom in the reception of charting K-pop songs. 
							The second was aimed at uncovering language attitues towards the use of Spanish in reggaeton songs. 
							Finally, I created a novel methodolgy that made use of part-of-speech syntactic features to cluster memes in viral foreign language songs.</p>

							<!-- <h3>Case Study 1: Exploring the reception of BTS and BLACKPINK through the lens of fandom</h3>
							<p>
								This case study examined the work and reception of certifiably the two most popular K-pop groups in the English-speaking charts: BLACKPINK and BTS.
								After having filtered the YouTube comments for those that express an opinion using the <a href="https://github.com/Ursidaeic/ForeignLang-Music/tree/main/opinion_miner">opinion miner</a>, I collected keyword frequency data so as to perform some manual topic-modelling. 
								The conclusion I was able to draw from this was that commenters on BTS songs frequently used terms related to the fandom of the band, whereas BLACKPINK commenters overwhelmingly discussed the singers.
								Elving-Hwang asserts that K-pop production companies often attempt to foster parasocial relationships between singers and their fans and completed a study that found that Korean fans had a tendency to fixate on a particular 'idol' (K-pop singer) (2018).
								Based off this observation and the fact that the BLACKPINK singers' names were occurring with such great frequency within the corpus, I hypothesised that this same effect was occurring amongst English-speaking audiences.
								Whilst I could have set out to prove this hypothesis with computational analysis such as that performed in case study 2, I elected to instead do so with a musicological approach.
								The relative frequency of singer-tokens varied on different songs, and therefore I proposed that if I were not able to find any musicological reason why fans may decide to mention one singer over another in the comments section of a given video then that would point towards the expression of fan identity being the driving force behind the phenomenon.
								<br>
								<br>
								The first musicological analysis I carried out was statistical analysis of the sung-time of each singer and whether that had an effect on how likely they were to be mentioned over another band member in the comment section
								Due to time constraints, I narrowed my focus to the 5 most popular songs for BTS and BLACKPINK based on chart position and/or English language engagement on YouTube as this would necessarily prove us with more data from which to draw conclusions.
								Figure 1.1 displays the sung-time and singer-token frequencies for these 10 songs comparatively as a composite bar chart
								<br>
								<br>
								<div style="text-align: center;">
									<img src="images/vocals-times.png" alt="Composite bar chart displaying the sung-time and singer-token frequencies for 5 songs comparatively" style="text-align: center;"/>
									<figcaption>Figure 1.1 - Composite bar chart displaying the sung-time and singer-token frequencies for 5 songs comparatively.</figcaption>
								</div>
								<br> 
								<br>
								Two conclusions were draw from this data through a number of statistical analyses: <br>
								1) Although initial uniformity between the datasets for BLACKPINK imply correlation, analyses of specific singers demonstrate that this is incidental. <br>
								2) Furthermore, comparison with the data pertaining to BTS highlights that it is possible to predict distributions of singer-name tokens on the basis of how much time in the song that singer occupies vocally; for BTS songs, there is a correlation between sung-time and singer-token frequencies, but not for BLACKPINK. <br><br>
								What followed was the first of two schematic analyses, with this one focussing on of two of BLACKPINK’s songs that displayed the most marked difference in singer-token distributions: ‘How You Like That’ and ‘As If It’s Your Last’. 
								In the former, commenters mention each of the band members with roughly the same frequency whereas in the latter there is a great deal of variation. 
								By comparing 6 musicological features – style, sung-language, rhythmic variation, diatonicism, vocal range, and solos – I was once again able to confirm that there was no musicological basis for one singer being favoured over another in the comments of these songs. <br>
								The second schematic analysis was concerned with mapping the sections of the song that a given singer occupied vocally.
								The rationale for examining the songs in this way was that, logically speaking, if a singer occupies more time vocally in a song, commenters may be more likely to discuss them.
								<br>

									<figcaption>Figure 1.3 - Waveform diagram of 'As If It's Your Last' created using Sonic Visualiser<sup>2</sup> segmented by singer and song structure.</figcaption>
								</div>
								<br>
								<br>
								In contrast to previous analyses, by examining the above colour-coded waveform diagrams and comparing them to token-distributions, I was actually able to find a musicological reason as to why frequencies of singer-tokens varied.
								I determined that the more uniform distribution of ‘As If It’s Your Last’ lead to a less uniform distribution of singer tokens, and I hypothesised that the reason for this was that its less complicated vocal structure meant that listeners/viewers of the song would have more uninterrupted time with which to form an opinion regarding a given singer’s vocal performance.
								For example, the other vocalists’ sections could act as a musical foil for Lisa’s musically and stylistically distinct section, thereby causing it to be remarked upon with a much greater frequency.
								Simply put, the fact that Rosé raps whilst the others (generally) do not would mean that she would stand out more in the minds of the commenters.
								<br><br>
								It is clear that musicological factors such as structure and style of vocals can at least partially influence singer-token frequencies between songs by the same artist. 
								This was an important discovery to have made and has great potential for future research, however, there still remains the question as to why singer-tokens appear in much greater quantities within the BLACKPINK corpus compared to that of BTS
								In order to investigate this, I elected to investigate the degree to which the vocals of individual singers feature more heavily over the other musical elements of the songs.
								I did so by controlling for chart popularity – specifically by selecting songs that displayed very similar average chart positions. 
								This is because songs by both bands which place higher in the charts also tend to display fewer instances of singer-tokens relative to the corpus size for the obvious reason that first-time listeners/commenters are not going to know the names of the band members.
								Four songs present average chart positions close enough together for popularity of the song to be considered a controlled variable: 
								a) Life Goes On (BTS) and How You Like That (BLACKPINK) with average chart positions of 19 and 19.3 respectively
								b) Fake Love (BTS) and Lovesick Girls (BLACKPINK) with average chart positions of 35.3 and 38 respectively 
								I then comparatively examined the instrumental elements of these two groups, the results of can be found in table 1.1 and 1.2 below.
								<br>
								<br>
								<div style="text-align: center;">
									<figcaption>Table 1.1: Table displaying the different instrumental elements of 'Life Goes On' and 'How You Like That'</figcaption>
									<img src="images/group-a.png" alt=":Table displaying the different instrumental elements of 'Life Goes On' and 'How You Like That'" style="text-align: center;"/>
									<br>
									<figcaption>Table 1.2: Table displaying the different instrumental elements of 'Fake Love' and Lovesick Girls'.</figcaption>
									<img src="images/group-b.png" alt="Table displaying the different instrumental elements of 'Fake Love' and Lovesick Girls'." style="text-align: center;"/>								</div>
								<br>
								<br>
								Whilst both BLACKPINK songs present relatively comparable levels of complexity, the same does not fully hold true for the BTS songs.
								This is not reflected in the distributions of singer-tokens in the corpus of comments, however.
								The total frequencies of singer-tokens for ‘Life Goes On’ and ‘How You Like That’ – group A - are 1.04% of the total tokens and 4.11% respectively; for ‘Fake love’ and ‘Lovesick Girls’ - group B - they are 1.51% and 4.80% respectively.
								On the one hand, the fact that the singer-token frequencies for BLACKPINK are higher than those of BTS undermines the applicability of Elfving-Hwang’s contentions to the BLACKPINK fanbase (2018). 
								This is because it implies there is a strong basis to the hypothesis that the complexity of instrumental arrangement directly leads to commenters focussing less on vocalists in the group. 
								However, if this were the case, it would be expected that the proportion of singer-tokens between the two songs in group B to be much greater due to the fact that, as previously mentioned, ‘Fake Love’ is much more instrumentally complex. However, the inverse is true. 
								Commenters for the BLACKPINK song in group A discuss the singers at a rate of just under four times as often as those of its counterpart. 
								In comparison, the frequency of singer-tokens for ‘Lovesick Girls’ in group B is around three times that of ‘Fake Love’. 
								The conclusion that can be drawn here is that, based on the assumption that more complex instrumental arrangements draw focus away from the vocal lines and their respective singers in a song, it is highly likely that there is no musicological basis for BLACKPINK songs to be featuring higher levels of singer-tokens than those of BTS.
								<br><br>
								In sum, the two methods of analysis I carried out offered rich data to support the argument that the phenomenon of fandom is a principal means by which English-language K-Pop fans interact with its musical artefacts.
								Whilst we were able to find data supporting discrepancies between singer-token frequencies amongst songs by the same artist, there was no musicological basis for the great difference in how often BLACKPINK commenters discuss the singers versus BTS commenters.
								Thus, we can claim with a degree of certainty that the Elving-Hwang’s<sup>1</sup> assertion regarding the focus on specific singers in Korean fandoms being a form of fan expression also holds true for English-speaking audiences in the case of BLACKPINK. 
								The one confounding factor here is the fact that K-pop is an audio-visual product, and thus it could be that fans are actually commenting on some feature of these videos that is not captured by our purely musicological analyses.
								Consequently, future research may wish to explore this dimension of the songs in order to investigate the effect, if any, that the visual has on the singer-token frequency distributions
