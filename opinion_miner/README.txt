A Support Vector Machine trained on YouTube comments to identify comments that contain opinion-sentiment. A pickled trained model is supplied but the scripts used to train said model are as well if you have your own dataset.


Additionally, the tagged training set I used to train the SVM can be found in the resources folder. 


If you have your own corpus of comments, place it in the comments folder. If not then the corpus I collected throughout the course of the project can be found here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1X3rqGrnYG3Dz89ziLyvv6gcf7yz0ACpJ?usp=sharing
