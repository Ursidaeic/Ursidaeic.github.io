This is a tool to download all the comments and replies to a YouTube music video using Google's YouTube API V3 (note: at present, the API only supports the downloading of replies to top-level comments, not replies to replies).
For this program you will need to create a developer key, which can be done by following the steps found here: https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started. This key will need to be supplied at the command line.

Additionally, the url and video name will need to be placed in a .txt file in the same folder as the scraper_api.py file. In this folder, the video ID, artist name and song name will need to be formatted as such: videoId|ArtistName-SongName, eg. 0lapF4DQPKQ|BTS-BlackSwan.
